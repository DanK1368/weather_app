# Weather App
## Api Practice using AccuWeather's Api to fetch weather information

Just a simple weather app, that allows a user to enter a location and the corresponding temperature will be displayed. 

The main focus was not on the design, but for me to practice fetching data from an external source. In this case the AccuWeather Api was used to get weather information on a specific location.
